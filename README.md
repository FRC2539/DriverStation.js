# Downloads

Downloadable installers will be available at the first beta release.

# Compile from Source

Compiling from source can be found in the [node-webkit documentation](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps). 
You still have to run *npm install* in the cloned git repository before
packaging. Otherwise, DriverStation.js will be unresponsive because of
JavaScript crashing from dependency errors.

``` bash
$ npm install
```
